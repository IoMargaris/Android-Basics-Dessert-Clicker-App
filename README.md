# Android-Basics-Dessert-Clicker-App

Based on Google's online training (Unit 3: Navigation) course to explore the Android lifecycle and log messages to
the Android console (Logcat)

### 📙 What I learned
- How to print logging information to the Logcat.
- The basics of the Activity lifecycle, and the callbacks that are invoked when the activity moves between states.
- How to override lifecycle callback methods to perform operations at different times in the activity lifecycle.

### ⚙️ What I built
- Modified a starter app called DessertClicker to add logging information that's displayed in the Logcat.
- Override lifecycle callback methods and log changes to the activity state.
- Run the app and note the logging information that appears as the activity is started, stopped, and resumed.
- Implement the onSaveInstanceState() method to retain app data that may be lost if the device configuration changes. Add code to restore that data when the app starts again.
